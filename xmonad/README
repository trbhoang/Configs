* Xmonad and Gnome on Ubuntu 11.04

  1. Install Xmonad

     [Desktop Entry]
     Encoding=UTF-8
     Name=Xmonad
     Comment=Frustration free desktop experience
     Exec=gnome-session --session=xmonad
     Icon=xmonad.png
     Type=XSession

  3. Make file "/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/xmonad.session" which contains:
     [GNOME Session]
     Name=Xmonad
     Required=windowmanager;panel;filemanager;
     Required-windowmanager=xmonad
     Required-panel=gnome-panel
     Required-filemanager=nautilus
     DefaultApps=gnome-settings-daemon;

  4. Create a xmonad config file .xmonad/xmonad.hs

* Using Xmonad on Ubuntu 11.04
  1. Application launcher
     Use Kupfer as app launcher. It's very good launcher. We can config to use other shortcut key (ex: M-o) to start the launcher. It prevents using M-p which conflicts with both Ubuntu and Xmonad.
